Talking about API (Application programming interface) 
Just the thing we were using in our everyday life but never noticed that its actually an API request
so have you ever used "sort" method in "python" But never knew how it is actually doing that (Its a tim sort BTW)
aa... its a concept of abstraction (Hiding unusefull onformation) 
definately You got it right, this is actually what an APi dose.
Have you ever heard about Command Line Interface, Graphical user interface..
Here we simply have a Application Programming interface, Its an interface 
We have something complex written somewhere and what we need to careis all about the functionality we need
ex. sort method we talked about earlier
ex. Spotify play music	
	- yes sir (Played music) 
	But the programmers of Spotify have they actually been coading 010101010 signals sent to speakers. NO !
	here OS comes in role 
	just call the method to send audio-format to speakers and done (Melodyyy)
	this is a API too.
	The functionality provided by our mighty OS.

- Ok so now i got what APIs are but why havent you talked about web till now 
Yes, WEB based API(s) they are a kind of API(s) not all API are web based 
As we talked about interface, it need to have some written code somewhere
- Oh on the cloud ? 
Absolutely correct this is a web based API 

- can i build bu own API ? 
Why Not 
But if everyone builds their own API it would be a mess
to avoid this some standard has to be ment. 
- have some REST ! 
Hurry we have our standard what we call as "REST API"
You must have heard about this thing earlier 
be restfull coz all REST APIs will follow RESTfull

- What is REST ? 
Representational state transfer
Here we will have some constraints to call a API RESTfull
1. Client-Server Architecture
2. Statelessness
3. Layered system
4. Cacheability
5. Uniform Design
6. Code on demand

- Btw do you know what is a url : universal resource locater
we also have something called uri : universal resource identifier
also heard of .. json : javascript object notation

- lets take our hands with some apis now 
its twilio : its an api service which helps us send text messeges, calls...
(its paid btw but a great to study you wil get a trial $15 )

- postman starting with a chrome extension now it is a full fledge application 
you can use it to make all your api requests organised at one place
